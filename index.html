      <p>Hey Wassup, My name is Rhupert Mendoza Castro, and I was born on September 6, 2008, in marikina City. I'm the eldest child in my father side, and we're 8 in my mother side, and I am the sixth among my siblings, my mother taught me the value of responsibility and hard work, and If you're wondering why I only mentioned my mother, it's because I grew up without my father. I grew up in a simple home, but my childhood was filled with love,lessons, and unforgettable memories.</p>
